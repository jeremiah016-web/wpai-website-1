            To start off the New Year, our young adults coined in the idea of a
            trip to the Bible Museum in DC as an educational trip for the WPA
            Church community. The Youth, led and organized this visit, which was
            welcomed by all and was a big success, thanks to a warm winter weather
            and an energetic group of members. With more places to explore and
            things to learn, our church looks forward to have many more such
            educational trips throughout the year.

              We are proud of our youth, who have exhibited time and again that
              they honor the word of God. They are very energetic and have great
              leadership skills. We feel they are more than ready to carry the
              torch of our community values and family morals forward into the
              world. We dedicate one Sunday a month for English worship, which
              is co-ordinated by the Youth.
